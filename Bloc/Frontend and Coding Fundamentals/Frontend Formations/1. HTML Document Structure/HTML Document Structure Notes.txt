HTML Document Structure




When you open browser/navigate to a website or click a link, browser makes a request to a server. Then usually the server sends back HTML file that browser "renders" to your screen.

<!DOCTYPE html>
	Declaration that tells browser "this is an HTML document, we gonna use HTML5" (the latest version). 



<html> 
	After our doc declaration, we use opening/closing tags of <html>. All of the html code that we'll receive will be "nested" in here, and unpackaged, like a nesting doll. 



<head>
	Exists to designate metadata/link to external style sheets (like a CSS sheet) or JavaScript pages, none of the info within this element is displayed to the user directly. 
	<title> tag is nested inside every <head> tag, which we must fill out (we can call it whatever we want). 
	<script> can also be found within the <head> tag (and/or in the <body>). It's used to execute JavaScript inline or by reference.
	<link> tag is typically used to link to CSS stylesheets. <link> is always placed in the <head>.




<body>
	Where all the content will go. This element's content is what is actually displayed on the user's screen. Typical HTML page will have multiple sections/divided areas, which will in turn hold content. 
	<header> Is the title/logo of the page that the user can see. The <header> tag is a completely different thing from the <head> tag previously discussed. 
	<div> is a divided section within the <body>.  
	<p> stands for paragraph
