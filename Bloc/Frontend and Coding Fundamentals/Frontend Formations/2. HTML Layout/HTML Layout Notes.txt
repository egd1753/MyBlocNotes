HTML Layout Notes



Every web page is composed of sections or divided areas (<div>). When a webdev is handed a mockup of a webpage, they immediately divide page into separate sections/components. Every site is made up of tags within tags, and we can use them like bricks to build something.

Tags within <body>:
<header> 
	Usually starts off the <body>, but can be placed as a container in most places where we want intro content, or nav links. (We can't place <header> within a <footer>, <address>, or another <header> element.) It typically contains one or more heading elements (<h1>-<h6>), a logo/icon, authorship info, etc. 

<main>
	Specifies main content of a document. It should contain content unique to the document, and not content that is repeated across documents (like sidebars, nav links, etc.)
There is only one <main> per document, and it must not be a child of <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav>.

<section>
	Represents standalone section, can define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document (try to be semantic tho).
 
<aside>
	For sidebars/content that belongs more on the side from the content it's nested in, should be related to surrounding content. 

<div>
	Defines a division/section in an HTML doc. Often used as a container for other elements (for CSS styling purposes, performing tasks in JavaScript, etc.). Note: this now needs to be used sparingly, as it can reduce the accessibility of a web page.


<footer>
	Defines a footer, should contain info about its containing element. Typically contains: authorship, copyright, and/or contact info, sitemap, back to top links, related documents. You can have multiple <footer> elements in one doc. (Contact info inside a <footer> should go inside an <address> tag.)


Bonus Notes:
<br> should be used minimally, if at all, but can be used for writing addresses or poems (not separating paragraphs). Note: this is one of the handful of HTML elements that does not have a closing tag

The <h1>-<h6> tags change the size of text to emphasize. The smaller the number the bigger the text.
