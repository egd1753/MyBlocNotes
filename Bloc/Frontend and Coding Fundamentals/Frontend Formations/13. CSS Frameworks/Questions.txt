> Read the official documentation and analyze the three leading CSS frameworks in this checkpoint. Why are some used in specific projects over others? What are the deciding factors? Is it aesthetics, development team, or a particular feature such as built-in animation or an advanced grid system?

A: Bootstrap is open source and hugely popular, so it's often chosen because it's considered the standard. Because of its popularity, there is no shortage of tutorials, plugins, etc., which tends to be the main reason why it's chosen. Foundation is professional, not only aesthetically, but also in terms of their support, consultation, etc., and is maintained by the respected company ZURB. It's good for websites, emails, and even apps. Material Design is the brain-child of Google, and unlike other front-end frameworks, it doesn't rely on JS frameworks. It is meant to be immediately accessible, and usable even in older browsers.
