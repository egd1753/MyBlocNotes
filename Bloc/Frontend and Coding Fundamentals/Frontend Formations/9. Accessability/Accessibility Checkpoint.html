# Questions

> Why is accessibility so important?

A: It improves the user experience (especially for those using screen readers/have difficulty distinguishing color), it improves search engine optimization, and it's easier for future devs to read the source code.

> What are some forms of accessibility as it relates to web development?

A: Some forms are using proper semantics, using tables only for data, avoiding nested drop-downs that need fine motor skills to operate, making text/background clear with high contrast, etc. 

> In your own words, what does semantic mean?

A: Semantics involves studying meaning, symbols, etc. in a language, and how to communicate most effectively using that information.  

> What is semantic HTML?

A: Semantic HTML is descriptive, and tags are used that best describes the nested content. 

> What are some common accessibility issues your end users might have? What are some steps you would take to make their experience on your site better?

A: Low contrast for text/background can make it difficult to see, so make sure text is contrasted, bold, etc. Also avoid auto-playing media, and UI components that are difficult to use without fine motor skills. Make sure `<img>` tags have the `alt` attribute, or user could have difficulty reading page if it fails to load correctly. 

> What do we use the `<label>` tag for?

A: The `<label>` tag is used in forms to help label an `<input>` element.

# Code Practice 

```html

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--Declared the document type, because required in html-->
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Cats are the best!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
        <header> <!--Changed tag to <header> and moved under <body> to make it easier for devs to read-->
            <h2>My awesome site</h2>
        </header> 
     <!--Removed table, because we only use tables for data-->
        <aside>
            <p>Sidebar will go here</p> <!--Changed <td> to <aside> because we don't use tables for this-->
        </aside>
        <main> <!--Added <main> instead of the <table>--> 
            <article> <!--Added <article> for better clarity-->
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
            </article>   
                Check out this cat:
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Cat_November_2010-1a.jpg" alt="Image of cat" height="200" width="200"> <!--Added the alt attribute and height/width to make the <img> element more accessible-->
        </main>
        <!--Removed the multiple <br>, this sort of styling is clunky for screenreaders, and is better coded in CSS-->    
        <footer>Isn't it a great cat?!?</footer> <!--Changed <h1> to <footer> to improve semantics-->
  </body>
</html>
