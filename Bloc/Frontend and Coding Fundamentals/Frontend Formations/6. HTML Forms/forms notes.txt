<form> element



-password displayed as bullet points? There's a way to set that 

-we use the "post" form of submitting 

-this:   <input type="text" />    will create a box to enter text in. If I start typing before that and leave a colon, so that it could read `Username:<input type="text" />`, it will put the text before the colon as text before the text box.

-when building the text box for the password, it's best to use <input type="password" /> and not the type="text"  attribute




<form> tag has elements:
input - where users typically interact with a form. 
textarea - defines multi-line text input control
button - defines a clickable button, can hold text AND/OR images
select - creates a drop-down list
option - goes inside <select> or <datalist>, defines list option
optgroup - groups related options in drop-down list
fieldset - groups related elements in a form, draws a box around
label - defines a label for an <input>, helps with usability


<input>
	What a user typically interacts with in a form. This is a self-closing tag, and only contains attributes for itself. We use the <label> element to define labels for each <input> element. Inputs have lots of attributes, but here are some more common ones: 
name
required
type - used pretty frequently. 

The type="" attribute has many values, including:
button - defines clickable button (mostly used w/ a JS)
checkbox - 
color - 
date - 
datetime-local -
email - 
file - 
hidden - 
image - 
month - 
number - 
password - 
radio - 
range - 
reset - 
search - 
submit - 
tel - 
text - 
time - 
url - 
week - 



Extra Notes:
-<label> element uses for="" attribute with a value equal to the id attribute of the related <input> to correctly reference/label it, and the inner text is the label we want to use (this label will be visible).
