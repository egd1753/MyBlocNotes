Tables Notes


Tables are great and extremely common way to display data/lists of anything with multiple attributes (i.e., list of users w addresses/names/numbers, etc.). They are everywhere: Excel Sheets, restaurant menus, etc.  
Syntax will look something like:
...
<table>
    <thead>
	<tr>
	   <th>blablablah</th>
	   <th>moreblah</th>
	   <th>lastlyblah</th>
	</tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
	<tr>
	   <td>...</td>
	   <td>...</td>
	   <td>...</td>
	</tr>
     </tbody>
</table>
...

What this means is:
<table>
	Declares/creates a table. 

<thead>
	Declares table header/header cells, which is most important part of a table. Header cells label each column, specifying what the underneath data represents.  

<tr>
	Declares a new table row

<th>
	Adds header cells. We nest them inside the <tr> that's nested inside the <thead>, which allows us to label each column.

<tbody>
	Where the bulk of the content is gonna go (kinda like <body> for the <html> element). We will need to declare each new row within the <tbody> with <tr>.

<td>
	The first time we used <th>, but since we already have it all labeled now, we will use <td> (table data). This will add cells to the <tr> that it's nested in, and is where we enter the actual data that we are trying to describe in the table.
