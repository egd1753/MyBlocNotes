A: I learned that Atom is Bloc's preferred editor (I've been using VS Code). I also learned Window's Command Prompt isn't the kind of terminal I need. While installing Bash, I encountered some detailed setup options that weren't discussed in this chapter, so I went with the defaults or what was closest to Bloc's suggestions. I had most of the other applications installed already, and I own both a Mac and Windows computers (and also have experimented with the Linux distribution Tails installed on a live USB), so this checkpoint was fairly straightforward.
