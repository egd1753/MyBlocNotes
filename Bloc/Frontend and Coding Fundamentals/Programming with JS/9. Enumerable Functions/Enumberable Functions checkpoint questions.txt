# Questions

> Describe the `map()` function.
 
A: This function iterates over an arrray and creates a new array by transforming each item. 

> Describe the `filter()` function.

A: This function also iterates over the items in an array, but it keeps items with the condition is evaluated as `true`. 

> What is the difference between the `map()` and `filter()` functions?

A: `map()` is good for when we want to do something to every item in an array create a new array (without mutating the original), and `filter()` is more of a boolean-style function that returns items when the condition is `true` (the function "filters" out the items that we don't want as specified in our condition). 

# Code Practice

```javascript

var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,4,3,2];

var total = numbers
.filter(item => item > 3)
.reduce((total, item) => total + item);

console.log(total);
96
