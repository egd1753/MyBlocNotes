# Questions

> What does the acronym DOM stand for and explain in your own words what it is.

A: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It means that a web browser treats the HTML in a web page as a single object. We can use special JavaScript functions to access specific elements.

> How does the DOM make web programming more efficient?

A: If we have large web pages, there will likely be tons of HTML elements. If we are trying to find and edit a specific element that's potentially nested with hundreds of other elements, we can query the DOM using special JavaScript functions. This saves us the time of having to manually track down each element in the HTML document. 

# Code Practice

```javascript

var clothes = document.getElementById('list');
let newLi = document.createElement('li');
newLi.innerText='Mens T-shirt';
clothes.appendChild(newLi);
