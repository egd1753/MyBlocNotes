# Questions

> What is object-oriented programming?

A: It was created as an alternative to procedural programming, and it organizes information into single entities called objects. Each object is said to be an instance of a class, and the benefits of object-oriented programming is that it's easier to organize and manipulate data for larger, more dynamic jobs.

> What is a constructor?

A: It's a special kind of method for creating an object within a class, and helps us create "blueprints" for "object types". 

> What is the purpose of the keyword `super`?

A: `super` allows us to access and call functions on an object's parent. 

> What are classes that do not use the keyword `extends` called?

A: Parent classes
