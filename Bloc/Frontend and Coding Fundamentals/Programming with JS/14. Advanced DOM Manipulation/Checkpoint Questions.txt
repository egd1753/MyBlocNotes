# Questions

> What is the difference between `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()?`

A: `document.querySelector()` returns only the first element it finds that matches the query, and `document.querySelectorAll()` returns an array-like list of all matches.

> What is the difference between `getElement(s)By` and `querySelector(All)`?

A: Both kinds functions are used to query the DOM, but the `querySelectorAll` allows us to pass multiple arguments that need not be `class` arguments, while `getElement(s)By` functions either only allow one argument, or only allow multiple `class` arguments (as with `getElementsByClassName()`)

> What do JavaScript event handlers do and what is an example of one?

A: They are functions that "handle" what happens after certain events. An example is if an event is triggered by a user clicking a button, in which case we'd use the "onclick" event handler. 

# Code Practice

```javascript

let list = document.getElementById('list');
let shirts = list.getElementsByTagName('li');
for(let i = 0; i < shirts.length; i++) {
    shirts[i].onclick = () => {
    console.log(shirts[i].innerText + ' Clicked!');
}
}

```
