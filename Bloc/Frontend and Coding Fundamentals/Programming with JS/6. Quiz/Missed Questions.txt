Q: Which of the following expressions will evaluate as true?
A: 'Great Wall of China' != 'great wall of china'
(I put: 'Great wall of China' == 'great wall of china')
Why? Cause == is the equality operator, and JS IS CASE SENSATIVE, so these two operands aren't equivalent. 



Q: What would the following code output?
console.log('There will be ' + (42/7) + ' more weeks of winter.');
A: 'There will be 6 more weeks of winter.'
(I put: 'There will be (6) more weeks of winter.')

Q: Which of these is not a valid variable name in JavaScript?
A: favorite-food
(I put: $favoriteFood)
Why? Cause a dash is interpreted as a subtract operator, and although you should begin an identifier with a letter, you can also begin with a $ or a _
