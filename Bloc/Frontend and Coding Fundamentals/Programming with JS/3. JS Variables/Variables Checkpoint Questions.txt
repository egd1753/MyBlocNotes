# Questions

> What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

> If you want to create a variable called `mentor` and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

A: `var mentor='Jacob Martens'`

> How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

A: `function mentor(name) {
console.log('Jacob Martens')
}`

> Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

A: `var` is used to declare a new variable, scoped to the entire function. `const` is used to declare a variable that we won't reassign a value to (we want the value of the variable to be "constant"). `let` is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later; however, unlike `var`, `let` used with `{}` allows us to scope a variable to a specified block of code. 

# Code Practice

```javascript
